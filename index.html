                <h1>Paid to Play: A Breakdown of the Top 100 Twitch Streamers</h1>
                <p>Can you really make thousands playing video games from your parents' basement? Some are, and they're doing it on a site called Twitch. Started in 2011, Twitch is a streaming service with over 140 million active users per month, accruing an estimated $1.54 billion annual revenue. Users watch their favorite streamers do anything from cook to dance to work out. The most popular type of content on the platform is gaming. </p>
                <div class="row align-items-center">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <img src="img/Narrative/Ludwig.png" class="align-bottom" alt="Ludwig Ahgren">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <div id="table-container"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Ludwig Ahgren started streaming on Twitch in May, 2018. 3 years later, he's the most subscribed to streamer on twitch with 246611 subscribers. Each pays him $5 a month to watch him play video games[link], taste test cheeses[link], or try on costumes with his girlfriend[link]. </p>
                <p> Ahgren's subscriber count skyrocked in early March 2021 when he began a "subathon" and event in which a streamer performs actions or offers rewards in return for subscriptions. Ahgren's reward was to stay live a few seconds longer for every subscriber. At the time of writing, he has been streaming non-stop for 28 days. </p>
                <p>Mr. Ahren isn't alone in the amount of money he has made streaming. Streamers can make tens of thousands of dollars per month. Mr. Augren has revealed he made at least $100,000 over the course of his 28 day subathon. </p>
                <p>So who exactly are these content creaters making boatloads of money working at home playing video games?</p>

                <p> Like 98% of the top 100 streamers on Twitch, Mr. Ahgren is male. Despite 35% of viewers on Twitch being female, the top eschelon of streamers remain overwhelmingly male. </p>
                <p>One of the rare female streamers in the top 100 is Imane Anys or Pokimane. Anys began streaming in 2013 playing games like League of Legends, and Fortnite. </p>
                <p>In terms of her age, she's no anomaly. Like 32% of top 100 streamers she's between 18 and 25 years old (24).</p>

                <p>Some have questions about the lasting potential of Twitch. Is a business model based around voluntary subscriptions and donations sustainable? Will the lack of diversity on Twitch be its downfall? Will twitch expand to a wider audience beyond gaming? We invite you to think about these questions as you explore the backgrounds, personalities, and stories of the Twitch elite. </p>
